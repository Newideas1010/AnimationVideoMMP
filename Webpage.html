    <h1>Singing Girl</h1>
    <h2>By Irandel Martinez</h2>
    <p>This story is mainly about how street performers still carry on singing or doing what they love for money and credibility. I made it because we don't realise how much effort it takes to be standing and singing all the time while in front of many people. It's not political because Its mostly for entertainment when it comes to street performers or ways of earning money. </p>
